# Project Happy Thoughts API

This is an API built with mongoose with the help of MongoDB. It's connected to the frontend here: https://sage-bavarois-1b13f0.netlify.app/

It is possible to POST new happy thoughts, GET older happy thoughts and 'like' them via PATCH. 

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

## The problem
The problem i came by was displaying the data in the frontend, it turned out to be some misspelling in the Schema and using a different property. I solved it by going through the code, both front and back, to understand the problem and solve it. It brings a good understaning of the code. I used postman, MongoDB compass and atlas, express, Node.js and mongoose. 

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
