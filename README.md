# Project Happy Thoughts API

This is an API built with mongoose and MongoDB. It's connected to the frontend here: https://sage-bavarois-1b13f0.netlify.app/

It is possible to POST new happy thoughts, GET older happy thoughts and 'like' them via PATCH.
Ive also added name input-feald and a DELETE function 

## The problem
The problem i came by was displaying the data in the frontend, it turned out to be some misspelling in the Schema and using a different property than in the previusly made frontend. I solved it by going through the code, both front and back, to understand the problem and solve it. It brings a good understaning of the code. I used postman, MongoDB compass and atlas, express, Node.js and mongoose. If i had more time i'd would add Pagination, and categorys and update the styling in the frontend.
